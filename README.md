# Automated Security Scanning in CI/CD

## Objective
Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline using *Trivy* or *Snyk* to ensure security compliance and early detection of vulnerabilities.

## Steps
1. **Install Trivy/Snyk** in the CI/CD runner to enable security scanning.
2. **Scan Docker images** for vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Fail builds** if high or critical vulnerabilities are found to prevent insecure deployments.
4. **Store scan reports** for compliance and security auditing.
5. **Send alerts** to Slack/Teams to notify the team of detected vulnerabilities.
6. **Schedule periodic scans** to continuously monitor security risks in containerized applications.

## Expected Outcome
- **Automated security checks** integrated into CI/CD.
- **Early vulnerability detection** before deployment.
- **Compliance with best security practices** in software development.

## Usage
Users can pull the prebuilt Docker image to automate vulnerability scanning in their pipelines:

```bash
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/trivy-security-demo:latest
```

To manually scan an image:

```bash
trivy image your-dockerhub-username/trivy-security-demo:latest
```

## CI/CD Workflow Overview
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** runs on every push, pull request, and scheduled intervals.
- **Builds fail if high/critical vulnerabilities** are detected.
- **Trivy report** is generated and stored for auditing.
- **Slack/Teams notifications** alert the team about security issues.
- **Secure images are pushed to Docker Hub** for further use.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more security tools like *Grype* or *Clair* for multi-tool scanning.
- Implement *Kubernetes security scanning* for live environments.
- Automate security patching suggestions.
